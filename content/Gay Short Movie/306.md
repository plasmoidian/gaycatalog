From the Director **[Elliot London](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2467243/)** and featuring the gorgeous **[Brian Estel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3614621/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)** this short gay themed movie may surprise you in the last second. What I like about this one is the fact that almost everything is not sold to you, but left completely for you to imagine. Seems a bit abstract, but if I tell you more, I'll ruin the ending. Let's discuss in the comments below!
