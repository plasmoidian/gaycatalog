Despite seeming provocativeness, this chamber piece tells a very simple story. A story of how hard it is to be sincere with each other, and a story of love of love that appears as soon as a wall between you and other person starts crumbling. 

The issue of sincerity finds its clear reflection in the Russian title of the movie - Tonight I'll be myself. The title is nice, but it's better suited for some other movie, a movie with a clear idea of explicit decision. CJ, on the other hand, is a different person every night, with every client (today, for an instance, he is a guy from Utah). 

And Ash, on the contrary, has to repeat, over and over again, that she is not a person she seems to be. This is why the heroes have to face sincerity, quite unplanned and unprompted. 

*This is another ASPD production. It features the same actor from Teens like Phil and We are animals.*
