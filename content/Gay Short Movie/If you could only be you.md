If you could only be you is a pleasant surprise among the gay short films. It has a consistent plot, unique in its own way, and decent acting.

It starts with Chris remembering when he asked her wife to marry him. Beautiful scenario, the sunset, the beach, the wind, the golden water.

But his life isn't like that anymore. His own lies became a burden in his marriage. And now it is time to face the truth about him.
