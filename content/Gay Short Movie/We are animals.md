This beautifully filmed, bold and daring alternate historical fable is set during the 1980s AIDS crisis. When a closeted young man finds himself in the midst of an anti-government coup, he joins in the fight against the strict regime that is being enforced upon them.

One quick note: ASPD productions, the producer, own the right for this and several other short films. For years they kept removing all their content from youtube. Finally they created their own channel and uploaded their movies. Congrats for the initiative.
