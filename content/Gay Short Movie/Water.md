We find in Agua a short film as necessary as that same element. Necessary to understand, perhaps, how feelings work. We do not take revenge, it's not a masterclass. Neither the most eminent scholars can ever understand. We did not expect a conclusion by the script written by the director, Ricardo Esparragoza with Omar Robles. But things like that help us, especially to add points of view.

I bet it happened to everyone. I do not want to spoiler and reveal anything of the film, so I will put it like this: have you ever, dear reader, liked someone? I do not know you all, but I bet my thumb -which I love so much because it allows me to put spaces to this text- to yes.

Before I let you watch this amazing short film, let me mention that I'm in love with [Aristeo Mora](https://www.facebook.com/Aristeofono), the protagonist. He is so gentle, so cute.
