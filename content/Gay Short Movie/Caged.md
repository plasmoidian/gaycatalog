Caged shows a slice of life between emotionally charged young adults in The Netherlands, starting with a lap around the running track between friends David (Joel Mellenberg) and Niels (Josha Stradowski). Both accomplished athletes, David finds himself embroiled in the typical feud between testosterone-fuelled sports atmospheres and friends of alternative lifestyles.

The short film plays gay conflict at a sometimes overly simple level, but the ambiguity introduced in regards to the status of the sexual identity of Niels, and his lack of importance to the critical narrative arc of David’s emotional growth is a welcome change from the norm. Although the film makers struggle with subtlety when portraying the elements of society that make life hard for LGBT individuals, they do well to preserve the innocence and integrity of its main characters, creating a heart-warming look at the strength and resilience of true friendship.
