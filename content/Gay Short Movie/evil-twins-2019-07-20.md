It’s the story of two twins. One of them is ready to spend an afternoon on the riverside with his mates until he is confronted with an extreme situation that will force him to decide if he will fight for his friends or for his brother. Jealousy and violence play a part. It might also be a plan organized by both brothers. What relationship exists between the twins? What do they share? What kind of rivalry exists between them?

Honestly it is more of a fashion film or commercial than a gay short film itself. But hot shirtless guys... why not, huh?

An interesting interview with the producers from Alexan Movies was published [KaltBlut magazine](https://www.kaltblut-magazine.com/kaltblut-presents-evil-twins-a-fashion-short-editorial-interview/).  

**KB: In EVIL TWINS there’s a magnificent work on photography, do you get involved a lot in these aspects?**

ALEXAN: I like working with photography from a very natural side, Sebastian Ferrari is my photographer and he is really aware of the things I like. I don’t know much about the technical aspects of photography, I just realize right away when the result is something I really like or I don’t.

You can read the full interview in the website above.
