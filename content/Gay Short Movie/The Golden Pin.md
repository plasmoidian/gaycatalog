Set in Canada’s multicultural milieu, Long, an only child, has kept his homosexuality a secret from his parents. Under pressure from his father to continue the family line, Long proposes to his long-time girlfriend Vanessa, much to the chagrin of Long's swim teammate Ryan, who confronts Long about his true feelings at their next swim practice. 

Sensing her son's growing distress, Long's mother tells him about a painful choice she made just before she married his father.

The film had its world premiere at the Toronto Inside Out Film and Video Festival on May 20, 2009. It won Best Canadian Short at the festival.
