First day of school and Marc (Marc Vilajuana) walks into his classroom holding hands with Carla, his girlfriend. The movie rapidly slides into Marc's growing fascination towards Alex (Alex Durán), the gay new kid who is bullied by the class thugs. Though Alex's ordeal is the recurring theme, the viewer gets an insight into Marc's discovery of his feelings for Alex in the blunt, unstarchy way of Spanish Latin-ness.

The film depicts the intimidating ground gay teenagers have to walk within the hostile, heavily prejudiced environment of the schools of our civilized world, where none of us has ever escaped discrimination in the many ways it is conceived and exerted.
