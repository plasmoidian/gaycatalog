Boy meets Boy. Boy falls in love with Boy. 

Popular young actors Kim Hye Sung (High Kick) and Lee Hyun Jin (Glory of the Family) star in the gay short film Boy Meets Boy. Directed by Kimjo Kwang Su, the short and sweet youth charmer is about the budding romance between two high school boys who meet on a bus. 

The two leads have no dialogue in the film, instead conveying puppy love through encounters and gazes. Ye Ji Won (Old Miss Diary) co-stars as a singing cupid who helps bring them together.
