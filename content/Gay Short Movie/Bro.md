Bro, from director Peter Michael, is a great short movie. It has a pontential story that many people can relate with, though based on too many clich√©s (for my taste). 

It's about Aaron and Harris, one is having problems with girls and the other is developing feelings towards the friend. The classic recipe for a sweet, lovely drama.

Will they get over it? Watch to find out.
