Here's a quick synopsis writen by [Amos Lassen](http://reviewsbyamoslassen.com):

> Eddie (Spencer Siegel) is a hormonal 14-year-old boy living alone with his mother in the suburbs. He is fascinated with the comb of his attractive older neighbour, Chad (James Ratliff). This is the story of adolescent yearnings. This is also a look at a gay teenâ€™s blossoming sexuality as he falls in lust with his older neighbor and he becomes very excited when he spies Chad measuring himself in the bathroom.  Chad is very good looking and he provides quite the surprise for Eddie at the end of the film.

This short movie was directed by Evan Roberts, who also made the short, somewaht similar, Yeah Kowalski!
