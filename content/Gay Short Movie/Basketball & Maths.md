French short only 6 minutes long. It's about Jerome (who is secretly gay) falling in love with a member on his basketball team named Cedric. He also tutors Cedric in math at home. One day during the tutoring Cedric leans over and kisses Jerome on the lips. Jerrome doesn't know how to respond. Cedric leaves thoroughly embarrassed and Jerome has to deal with his own thoughts. It all ends on a positive note.

Sweet cute little film. It's quick, well-done and the acting is good. The kiss is sweet and gentle and there's some casual male nudity (back view only) in a locker room scene. This was done in France to combat homophobia in schools. Worth seeing.
