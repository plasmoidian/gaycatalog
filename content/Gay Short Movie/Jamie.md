A short story about love and finding common ground, the British short film Jamie is a modern take on a blind date.  The story opens as Jamie is carefully avoiding his family to text with a man named Ben.  They agree to meet up with each other for the first time, prompting Jamie to sneak out of the house.

When the two men meet, they share war stories of their past flings.  Instant companionship is found as each man shares his harshest wounds and happiest times with the other.

Sebastian Christophers, the actor behind the main character, lives in London. He has been doing a lot of theater acting lately and I sincerely hope he gets the attention he deserves.

I love how he acts, the changes in his expressions and most of all his smile :)
