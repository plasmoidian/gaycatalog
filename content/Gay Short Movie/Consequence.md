Short film director/writter Peter Michael shared on his Youtube channel several of his movies and I'll be covering them all in the coming weeks.  I recommned you subscribe to his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekwuPGbcIgxBHYS4g7aglA) and support this open and lovely attitude. Peter also struggles with autism and the recent death of his mother and his videos are very interesting, a life lesson to me.

Now, let's get back to this short film: Consequence.

Synopsis provided by the director:

>  When Ty makes the biggest mistake of his life will it be possible to fix it? Or will he be forced to finally accepted the Consequence of his action?

P.s: I made the cover because I didn't find the official one to share. Hope Peter doesn't mind.
