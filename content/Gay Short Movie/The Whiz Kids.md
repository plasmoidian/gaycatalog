The Whiz Kids is such a bad name for this short movie! Freund means friendship in german, much more appealing in my opinion.

These two boys are very weird. They start the movie in what seems like a fight, it seems like on is the bully and the other is victim.

But somehow, they continuously grow closer to each other.

It's a nice movie, with no particular theme other than friendship. Worth watching, no doubt about it.

But you know what they say: once a jerk, always a jerk.
