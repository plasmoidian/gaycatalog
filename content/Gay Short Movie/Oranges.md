> Two boys are talking after a bicycle accident. The older is bragging about his experience with girls, but is that just a boast? 

This short Australian film depicts with warmth and without pretension the awkwardness of two teenagers starting to recognise and explore their homosexuality.

It was refreshing to see two actors cast who were the right age for these roles and who showed no reluctance to share a kiss on screen. Many older actors/actresses of whatever sexuality could take a lesson from these two.

The final image of the film which relates to the title and storyline has a beauty and simplicity that surprises and lingers.

I saw this film as part of the Pink Filmdays in Amsterdam, and it received a very warm reception, compared to many other higher budget, overstylised and less sincere offerings.
