### Official plot:

> In a house ruled by two alcoholic adults, these underage kids find a special comfort and refugee in one of western civilization’s oldest taboos: incest. There is an in-between area of sexual ambiguity, do they experience sex as a manifestation of carnality or rather as the one instance in which they can redefine their roles without fears or worries about the specular images of adulthood (their parents), and by extension, society? Carefully devised, J.C. Oliva’s short film circumvents controversy by offering us poetic images and flashbacks sequences that makes us understand why these characters do what they do, without judging them or exploiting them.
