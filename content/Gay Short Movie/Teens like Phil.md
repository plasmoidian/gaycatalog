Teens Like Phil is a short film by Dominic Haxton and David Rosler released in 2012 in the US. It is about two gay teens struggling to come to terms with their sexuality and the ways in which their true desires are repressed with tragic consequences.

As in the Director’s own words:

> Inspired by the alarming increase in real-life tragedies involving high school bullying and suicide, Teens Like Phil tells the story of a gay teen, Phil, and his former friend, Adam, who brutally bullies him.

> The film explores the complicated and painful circumstances surrounding this relationship in an effort to better understand the roots of the bullying epidemic. Phil’s story is ultimately a tale of survival and transcendence from this cycle of abuse.

> My hope is that the film will provide insight and support to the countless teens everywhere who have suffered at the hands of their peers.
