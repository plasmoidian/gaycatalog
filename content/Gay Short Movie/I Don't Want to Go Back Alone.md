The arrival of a new student in school changes Leonardo's life. This 15 year-old blind teenager has to deal with the jealousy of his friend Giovana while figuring out the new feelings he's having towards his new friend, Gabriel. 

Short and sweet, delicate and sensible, "Eu Não Quero Voltar Sozinho" ("I Don't Want to Go Back Alone") brings us the story of Leonardo (Guilherme Lobo), a blind teenager who develops a crush on Gabriel (Fabio Audi), a new boy in his school of whom he becomes friends, and Leonardo also deals with the jealousy of his long-time friend Giovanna (Tess Amorim) who is always taking him home, and now she's more on second plan after the appearance of Gabriel in their lives.

In its 17 minutes, the short explores two diversities that hardly ever are well presented in films (specially together) and hardly ever are not targeted or labeled by societies in general: people who are blind and people who has an affection/sexual interest on someone of the same sex. The use of both diversities is very relevant in a society that tends to ignore the difference or to deplore his similar human being just because of some variations. So, here's a movie that brings a better understanding on dealing with differences and why people must be tolerant to one another, to respect their individuality's. The film succeed it in this issue but not everyone got happy with this. Here's a sad story: this awarded short was selected by the government as part of a educational/cultural film program to be presented in schools, related on how sexual diversity must be respected and all, focused on students of the same age as the ones presented in the film. So far, so good, except that one state banned the film of their schools pressed by religious groups which only heard of the film. Very sad, since no one talked more about dealing with diversities in fair terms than the current government, and hearing that one state still wants to live like 50 years ago, without evolving in their laws, moral and all is such a disappointment.

Besides this controversy, this is a must see film, well acted by the young cast and the few adults on scene. It has so many surprises to make your heart beat fast at all moments. One of the most beautiful short films I've seen. I really loved this story (which is going to be made as a feature film next year) 10/10
