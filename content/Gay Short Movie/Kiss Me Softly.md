This movie is about a boy who struggles with his sexuality. He lives with his parents and every day he grows tired of being in the shadow of his dad, who's a singer and performer.

What can he do to get in terms with himself and get attention from his father? How far will he go?

A gentle, yet unreal, story about the first step.
