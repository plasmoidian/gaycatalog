In short, this is a work that achingly illustrates the inner turmoil of a man longing to leave social conformity behind and just be his sexual self in an environment devoid of homophobia. And frankly, that isn't much to ask for; now is it? That the short is open-ended can leave you in two minds as to the outcome. Yet to my mind the message is clear, given this is the story of a man who finally realizes that the life he yearns to live, lies just beyond the horizon. Beautifully played, there's a lot to like here, even if the camera is all too coy in the nudity department. As ever, check it out below and see what you think.
