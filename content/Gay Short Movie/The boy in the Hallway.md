This short video you are going to watch is not actually a short film (?!). Someone with plenty of free time took together some pieces from the movie *Cuentos de verano* and made an hilarious piece.

I have no ideia where the name came from or who did it, but it's going to make sense when you see it.

Now you might even consider to watch the full movie! But let me make it clear: this is not a gay movie! *Cuentos de verano* is about a writer who is dumped by his girl and this affects his writing style greatly. His overbearing agent decides to watch over him to not let this happen!
