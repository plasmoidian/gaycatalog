This is the short film that five years later is going to inspire The Mudge Boy full length movie.

Fishbelly White has a very dear place near my heart, it was one of the first gay themed movies I first saw.

It is about Duncan, a teenager who recently lost his mother. He and his father are still struggling with it. They are still trying to get over it. But, actually, they are suffering much more than they realize.

Duncan lives on a farm and his only friend is Perry. All other boys see Duncan as the weirdo. So does Perry, to be honest, but he accepts Duncan the way he is, at least when they are alone.

I can't go into further details now, or it will lead to spoilers.
