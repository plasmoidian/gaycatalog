Alex feels atracted to Samuel, and even though his best friend warns him he has a girlfriend, something makes him think he is not that indifferent. 

A simple summer love story, spiced with jealousy, good dialogues and decent performances.

Somehow, this movie has the same delicacy present in many short films from the genre: the vulnerable young man and his wise girl friend, the possessive girl and his boyfriend as toy. A touching film, nothing out of the ordinary, just one of the stories remembering classic fairy tales. And this is the basic virtue in this case.
