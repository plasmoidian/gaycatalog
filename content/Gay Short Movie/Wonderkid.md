Shouldn't we wonder what it would be like, in the hypermasculine environment of football, to feel different but be afraid or discouraged to show it? 

The short film WONDERKID aims for that empathy, and achieves it - there's such spirit and passion in the young central character Bradley (Chris Mason) that the viewer is drawn into his headspace and mindset, even though his reactions are often hot-headed or impulsive. 

The scenarios, setting, relationships (particularly with his agent) and story arc all combine to place Bradley in a believable sporting world that still carries its own taboos and traditions, out of step with much of modern society. 

The film's powerful message - 'Be Yourself' - will resonate with anyone, particularly those who have ever felt on the fringes of a group or activity.

The wonderful review written above was posted to IMDB by [John Holmes](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur1547197/?ref_=tt_urv). It describes the movie so perfectly that I thought it was worth using it here.
