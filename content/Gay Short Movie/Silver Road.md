Two childhood friends have grown up in Ontario, Canada, around them only farms and fields. One of them is moving into a bigger city, so they spend one last day together. Things take a turn, when one of them lets his longing take over.

Here goes my personal opinion on this movie. I find it a bit disappointing. I can see it was crafted to be like that, to reflect real life and to remind you to not always trust your gut. 

But I just can't handle it. It builds so much expectation and then it all explodes right in front of you.

Still a good movie to watch.

#### About Jonathan Keltz

Before I let you watch the short film Silveroad, let me tell you a bit about Jonathan Keltz (the actor portrayed in the left side of the movie cover).

It's been 12 years since this movie was recorded and I was impressed to discover that [Jonathan is such a famous actor now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Keltz).

He's been acting in several movies and TV series, including Entourage and Reing.

One of his latest roles (a rather quick one tho, at least for now) is Hownland Reed, in Game of Thrones. He acts side by side with the young Raegar Targaryen. Take a look

This movie was funded by the [National Screen Institute (Canada)](http://www.nsi-canada.ca/2017/01/silver-road/). Bill Taylor was the writer and director, his other films include Donâ€™t Get Killed in Alaska and The Young Prime Minister.
