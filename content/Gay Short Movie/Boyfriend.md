Kyle Krieger wrote and directed this short movie for his application at a film school. It features Indar Smith and Jake Wilson, both talented and lovely actors.

This is a story about being tricked into a 'relationship' without knowing who the other person really is.

In Kyle's own words:

> When single, I have often encountered partners or friends or people who I was interested in who led me on and entertained my company without disclosing their honest intentions right away. Sometimes they would be in relationships and kept it hidden for a while until they couldn't any more. I was always so disappointed and sad when I would find out. A part of me understands why they would do that. I too have been in a relationship and was attracted at the newness and flirtation of a new acquaintance. Especially if my relationship was in a downturn or going through a rough patch. This film is just a glimpse into those emotions and that process. 

I wish I knew if Kyle got in the school he wanted. Hope so. I enjoyed the film.
