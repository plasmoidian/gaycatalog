Prora, the former Nazi German seaside resort on the Baltic Sea island of RÃºgen. What starts there between the German Jan and his French mate Matthieu as a harmless game, develops into a confusing confrontation that puts their friendship and their identities to the test. A story about growing up, a delicate fable about masculinity, love and friendship. A film by Stephanie Riethauser.

This is my new favorite! I'm so turned on by the story!

A small part of the plot is enough to understand how strong it is:

> Overwhelmed by their feelings, they try to escape, but they get lost in Prora's labyrinthine series of rooms and walkways. Desperate, tortured, a fight breaks out that leaves Jan alone and wounded. A few days later, Jan and Matthieu meet again on the beach. Will they become friends again before they part? A journey of self-exploration, an odyssey of male adolescence, Prora is a thrilling, tender story about love and friendship.

The actors Swen Gippa and Tom Gramenz are amazing, not only for being beatiful :-) , but also in the way they act while looking at each other in friendship or anger.
