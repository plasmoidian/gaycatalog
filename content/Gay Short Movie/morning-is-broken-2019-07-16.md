Isn't it terrifying? When a kiss is no longer a kiss, but the confirmation of a part of you so vehemently denied.

This is pretty much what is going on with Sam, played by Matthew Tennyson, in the short film **Morning is broken**.

He is at his brother's wedding when he meets Nick, Nigel Allen.

> For escaping the after hours of the wedding reception, they end up at Nick's nearby country farm and a gentle boat outing that is an outing in more ways, than one. In short, this is not so much a 'coming out' story; rather that of a 'coming to' piece; that of the realization of how a longed for first-kiss signals feelings that seemingly neither wish to face up to - at least at this moment in time.
