Here's the synopsis provided by the production:

> Have you ever lost somebody? Have you ever felt something you don’t understand? “WALK" is a short film that captures the beauty of knowing the struggle of losing a loved one to addiction. How do you cope? Let’s not pretend. It’s difficult. There is a fine line between knowing and not knowing on both ends. It’s past the spectrum of pain.
