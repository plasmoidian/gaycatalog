Felix is secretly in love with Ralph. This doesn't seem to be the biggest problem, but Felix is fifteen and Ralph is his thirty-four-year-old soccer coach. They meet every day in secret. One day, Felix's mother finds out and Ralph has to decide between feeling and reason.

The theme is not new and but it is something we need to debate. A couch involved in a forbidden relation with one of his minor students. The reveled truth, the decision, and the consequences. Although predictable, this is one of films who preserves the moralistic lesson as axis, the good performances and the right manner to solves the subject.
