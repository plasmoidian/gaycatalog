Jackpot is a short comedy gay film about a 14-year old trying to get some gay porn to have fun alone in his room! LMAO!

Jack Hoffman hears about a dozen magazines that are hidden in a trash can across town. He decides to take the risk and sneak to get them, but he gets busted on his way!

Fun dialogues, totally worth watching!
