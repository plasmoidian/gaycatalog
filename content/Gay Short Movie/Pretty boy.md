"Pretty Boy" is an American English-language short film from 2015. It runs for slightly over half an hour and received some more attention recently because the writer and director Cameron Thrower posted it on Youtube where it scored a solid amount of views already.

Looking at the solid deal of awards recognition it received, it is probably his most known work. The cast does not really include any famous names. This is the story of a father who gifts his son a birthday present, namely a night with a prostitute to cure him from his homosexuality. If you say you heard that before, you are probably correct as this plot is exactly the same as in a Sara Gilbert ("Roseanne") short film.

This film tackles a diverse number of subjects including bullying, questioning one's own sexuality, extreme fundamentalism, a clueless father, and the rarely seen portrayed "helpful and intelligent prostitute.
