> “Rightfully delivered in an unhurried pace and well shot and scored throughout, this is a moving work on the risks that journalists of both text and photo mediums take, in documenting the brutal ravages of man’s inhumanity to mankind; a poignant narrative that will no doubt resonate with many. All of which makes for a short film that whilst gay to the core, speaks volumes on how being in the wrong place, at the wrong time, can forever change your life and that of those around you. And for a debut piece, that’s a telling message, indeed.” — Dave Hall, Gay Celluloid
