Friends meet after a long time. The get stuck in a storm and find shelter in an empty house, where all those memories and fragments of the past meet again.

One of those minimalist short films about a state, who could be defined as friendship, ball of illusions and regrets. Or, only, as escape from yourself. 

The last scene is great, almost memorable. It is a scene about the viewer, the savage joy in the skin of fireworks. And the new beginning, another level of a relation. 

This movie has an amazing photography. Check it out!
