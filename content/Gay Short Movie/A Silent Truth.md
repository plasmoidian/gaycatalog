When I first sat down to watch this film (which I happened upon by accident!) I wasn't impressed at first. I found the acting a little staid, the premise of the story all too clich√© and the pace of the film a little too slow....

However, I must confess that I was to be proved wrong! I found myself identifying with Daniel Sovich's tearjerking portrayal of a young lad coming out in a Christian household and it was so believable towards the end that I must have caused a sharp spike in share prices for the company that produces my tissues! Beautifully acted by a gorgeous young man, dealing with such a maligned, sensitive topic.
