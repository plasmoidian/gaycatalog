A cheap story with good actors. One young man and an old one in a motel room. Guess you figured what's going on already.

They talk about their life issues, about the difficulties in trusting other people. And somehow what was a one night thing becomes a well developed dialogue until the truth is revealed. Worth checking out.

Enjoy!
