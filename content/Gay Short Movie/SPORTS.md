Yay! Here we are again with another [Kyle Krieger's movie](https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/boyfriend/)! The rising LGBT director and youtube personality is back on production with this short movie!

*SPORTS!* is five minutes long! And doesn't allow us to speak much about its plot without giving it all away.

So, I decided to share the official plot:

> When Zach brings along his thirsty, nosey roommate, Eduardo, to his basketball pick-up game with his straight best friend.. the outcome of the game takes an unexpected turn when Zach has to confront which team he is really on.
