Get Real is an inspiring representation of the life of a teenager that is about to come out to the world.

This movie, directed by  Simon Shore, is an example of a well scripted, well-crafted gay story. To top it up, the actors were marvelous, and all the acting is very pleasing to watch.

It's all about a young gay man finding his way through life and all the hard discoveries from adolescence. 

It is heart-warming to watch each scene blossom into situation that every one can relate to, and feel represented in a way.
