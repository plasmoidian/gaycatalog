"The Toilers and the Wayfarers" is almost classically "indie" -- shot in grainy black-and-white (perfectly appropriate for its subject matter), set primarily in an obscure milieu (the German-American community in New Ulm, Minnesota) and populated by a cast of complete unknowns. 

There are moments of almost comic amateurism mixed with fine moments that make you feel you are watching a particularly absorbing documentary.

The whole effect of the movie is knocked rather pleasantly askew by the casting of Matt Klemp in the starring role of Dieter. He is so movie-star beautiful that it can be a tad distracting (especially in view of how much of his body is frequently on display) and his performance gets off to a rather tentative start. More convincing, initially, are Andrew Woodhouse as the more self-aware Phillip and Ralf Schrig as the conniving Udo. But Klemp slowly comes into his own over the course of the film, charting a fall from innocence that is heartbreaking to watch (note, and possible spoiler: the trailers make this movie seem much more upbeat than it is). 

Totally worth seeing.

**Official plot:**

> Phillip and Dieter nearly suffocate hiding their sexual identity in the face of puritanical small town values. Joined by a mysterious German relative, the three misfits escape to the big city searching for a place to belong.

Please, notice the only youtube source I found has a very poor quality. I'm sharing it, because there is not other way to watch this movie. Unless you choose to [download torrent](http://optitopt.com/ZiA).
