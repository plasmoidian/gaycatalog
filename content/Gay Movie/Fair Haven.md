A young man returns to his family farm, after a long stay in ex-gay conversion therapy, and is torn between the expectations of his emotionally distant father, and the memories of a past, loving relationship he has tried to bury. 

Fair Haven provides a moving account of a father and son coming to terms with a family loss, and the struggle of trying to reconnect after this tragedy. It offers an honest and moving account of the son's readjustment to rural life after having spent time away, and the challenge of the father in rebuilding a close and loving relationship with his son.

Both the directing and writing of the film deserve specific praise. The audience is able to be taken along the emotional journey between father and son at a well thought out pace, with each chapter of their relationship unfolding without ever feeling rushed and portrayed by some strong performances from Michael Grant and Tom Wopat. The cinematography also deserves recognition, with the lush greenery of the Vermont farmland adding to the film's sense of 'real-life' authenticity. Fair Haven is a great example of all the best elements of indie film making,telling an important story of a topic that deserves more awareness and doing so with compassion without ever bordering into stereotypes.
