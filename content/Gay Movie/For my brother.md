This is not the kind of movie I like to share with you. I just finished watching it and I was determined not to post it. 

Let me tell you what's wrong:

Everywhere I look I see people tagging this movie as *LGBT*. But this is not the theme. This is clearly about abuse. It is about a disgusting father selling his son's body and also taking pleasure from it.

There are no signs that the boys are gay or going to be when they grow up.

Yes, there are naked scenes, but is that all that matters? Will you be excited from watching people being abused?

Maybe you need to do some thinking as well. And this is what made me share the movie after all.
