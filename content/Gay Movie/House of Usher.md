House of Usher is the adaptation of the thriller book [The Fall of the house Usher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher), written by Edgar Allan Poe. 

It is considered an homoerotic thriller. The actors are gorgeous and the scenes are super hot.

The movie develops its plot around Victor Reynolds and his arrival at House of Usher, where his old 'friend' , Roderick, lives with his wife Madeline Usher. 

As Victor starts to discover the history of the house, things start going weird until he realises the real danger.

Now let's talk abot the actors! *yay*!
