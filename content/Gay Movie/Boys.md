Jonas is in his thirties and he's not having a good time. Something in his past troubles him, haunts him.

After getting into a fight in a gay club, he is arrested by a former classmate and memories from the past start unfolding right in front of  him.

His sexuality, his first love and the event that changed everything. 

Will he come to a truce with himself? 

Jonas -the adult one, at least - is played by Félix Maritaud, who also played the main role in the movie [Sauvage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8307082/mediaviewer/rm1352614400), also from 2018. A nice, hot actor in 2 gays movies totally worth watching.

You can watch Jonas below, but keep in mind it is a french production for television, so there are no subtitles in the original youtube video. Of course you can use the translate caption feature.

If you prefer to download the movie and setup your own subtitles (from opensubtitles, for example), then you can [click here to download](http://biastonu.com/Nun). 

Notes:

1) You need an application to open magnetic links (torrents).

2) We do not upload files, we do not update them, we do not seed torrents, so on and so forth.
