Let me tell you loud and clear, this is a feature movie, not a short one. Some internet troll created a short version of the movie. It features only the gay couple, and the result is "Love without limits".

Yes, it is worth watching the short version, but if you wanna go deeper in the story, look for the film.

Joao Cajuda and Joao Pedro Silva play the role of two young men who gets instantly attracted to each other. Initially, they try to hide it, but as the story develops, the get closer and closer.

In case you got in love with João Cajuda, know that he is one of the most famous Internet Celebrities from Portugal. He has a travel agency and has been all around the world recording his YouTube travel diaries.
