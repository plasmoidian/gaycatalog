###Rift

Two actors, a summer house in the countryside and fifteen days to shoot the film - that is all you need to create a masterpiece if you just have a good story at the bottom.

Icelandic "RÃ¶kkur" (or "Rift") is about two men that processes memories of an ended love relationship in a place where folklore says that memories are distorted and you can not trust your senses. This opens up a truly surprising story that made the audience at the Gothenburg Film Festival scream of fear in the packed theater.

###Hello Again

Ten lost souls slip in and out of one another's arms in a daisy-chained exploration of love's bittersweet embrace. 

What goes around comes around in the sexual roundelay Hello Again, a musical pastiche flipping through the pages of time to episodically recount the couplings and uncouplings of New Yorkers in 10 different decades, beginning from the early 20th century to the present time.
