Since **Call me by your name** was announced Timothée Chalamet became everybody's new favorite. He is sexy in his own way, not being that much in the beauty standards. 

He had acted in several other movies before, though they weren't as big productions as Call me by your name. Of his previous works, Spinners certainly stands out for its quality and acting. And he is cute as hell, I should add. :D

Here's the synopsis:

> teenagers (Jace and Derek) try to get by working as Sign Spinners. 
> Harassment by local bullies leads Jace to make some unfortunate 
> decisions. A single mom living out of her car steps in to help.
