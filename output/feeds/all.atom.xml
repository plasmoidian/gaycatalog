&lt;p&gt;This is a story about being tricked into a 'relationship' without knowing who the other person really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kyle's own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When single, I have often encountered partners or friends or people who I was interested in who led me on and entertained my company without disclosing their honest intentions right away. Sometimes they would be in relationships and kept it hidden for a while until they couldn't any more. I was always so disappointed and sad when I would find out. A part of me understands why they would do that. I too have been in a relationship and was attracted at the newness and flirtation of a new acquaintance. Especially if my relationship was in a downturn or going through a rough patch. This film is just a glimpse into those emotions and that process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew if Kyle got in the school he wanted. Hope so. I enjoyed the film.&lt;/p&gt;

The story opens as Jamie is carefully avoiding his family to text with a man named Ben.  They agree to meet up with each other for the first time, prompting Jamie to sneak out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the two men meet, they share war stories of their past flings.  Instant companionship is found as each man shares his harshest wounds and happiest times with the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Christophers, the actor behind the main character, lives in London. He has been doing a lot of theater acting lately and I sincerely hope he gets the attention he deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short film WONDERKID aims for that empathy, and achieves it - there's such spirit and passion in the young central character Bradley (Chris Mason) that the viewer is drawn into his headspace and mindset, even though his reactions are often hot-headed or impulsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenarios, setting, relationships (particularly with his agent) and story arc all combine to place Bradley in a believable sporting world that still carries its own taboos and traditions, out of step with much of modern society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film's powerful message - 'Be Yourself' - will resonate with anyone, particularly those who have ever felt on the fringes of a group or activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official Synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:8 "And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed". In this story, João (Nuno Pardal) and Pedro (Pedro Sousa Loureiro) live in this garden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What João wants the most is for Pedro to be happy and the only way he found to make that happen is to support him in his escape with Sara (Sara Barros Leitão). On the other hand, Pedro learned how to love João and does not want to leave the garden. But one of them ate the forbidden fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

One of them is moving into a bigger city, so they spend one last day together. Things take a turn, when one of them lets his longing take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes my personal opinion on this movie. I find it a bit disappointing. I can see it was crafted to be like that, to reflect real life and to remind you to not always trust your gut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just can't handle it. It builds so much expectation and then it all explodes right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still a good movie to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;About Jonathan Keltz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I let you watch the short film Silveroad, let me tell you a bit about Jonathan Keltz (the actor portrayed in the left side of the movie cover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been 12 years since this movie was recorded and I was impressed to discover that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Keltz"&gt;Jonathan is such a famous actor now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's been acting in several movies and TV series, including Entourage and Reing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Handsome Jonathan Keltz" src="../../theme/img/johnny.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his latest roles (a rather quick one tho, at least for now) is Hownland Reed, in Game of Thrones. He acts side by side with the young Raegar Targaryen. Take a look&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Handsome Jonathan Keltz as Hownland Reed - Game of Thrones" src="../../theme/img/howlandreed.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie was funded by the &lt;a href="http://www.nsi-canada.ca/2017/01/silver-road/"&gt;National Screen Institute (Canada)&lt;/a&gt;. Bill Taylor was the writer and director, his other films include Don’t Get Killed in Alaska and The Young Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A kiss in the snow</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/a-kiss-in-the-snow/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-01T21:24:35-02:00</published><updated>2018-02-01T21:24:35-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-02-01:/gay-short-movie/a-kiss-in-the-snow/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"A kiss in the snow" was the first movie recorded and produced by Frankie Sunshine (known as Frank Mosvold).&lt;/p&gt;

He observes that Kev is "a bit of a wuss" after he fails to replicate the proper shotgunning technique and calls for Kev to come sit close to him for a test of courage, the knife game, which involves stabbing a knife between outstretched fingers at an ever-faster rate. The game is usually played with one person's hand at a time and as a gesture of what may be seen as self-sacrifice, Mick puts his hand over Kev's in order to shield Kev's hand from the brunt of an injury should it occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a train speeds by them, Mick accidentally cuts Kev and himself very slightly with the knife. They clasp each other's hands tightly and Mick, who suddenly seems very insecure and in need of affection is lovingly embraced by Kev, who perhaps has known all along why Mick brought him here.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Pink triangle</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/pink-triangle/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-27T17:18:50-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-27T17:18:50-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-27:/gay-short-movie/pink-triangle/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Nazi informant gets caught up in the Fuhrer's plan to eliminate homosexuals.

It runs for slightly over half an hour and received some more attention recently because the writer and director Cameron Thrower posted it on Youtube where it scored a solid amount of views already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the solid deal of awards recognition it received, it is probably his most known work. The cast does not really include any famous names. This is the story of a father who gifts his son a birthday present, namely a night with a prostitute to cure him from his homosexuality. If you say you heard that before, you are probably correct as this plot is exactly the same as in a Sara Gilbert ("Roseanne") short film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film tackles a diverse number of subjects including bullying, questioning one's own sexuality, extreme fundamentalism, a clueless father, and the rarely seen portrayed "helpful and intelligent prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The red bike</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/the-red-bike/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-27T17:18:50-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-27T17:18:50-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-27:/gay-short-movie/the-red-bike/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This  is a fabulous movie by Andrew Steggall.

What starts there between the German Jan and his French mate Matthieu as a harmless game, develops into a confusing confrontation that puts their friendship and their identities to the test. A story about growing up, a delicate fable about masculinity, love and friendship. A film by Stephanie Riethauser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my new favorite! I'm so turned on by the story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small part of the plot is enough to understand how strong it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by their feelings, they try to escape, but they get lost in Prora's labyrinthine series of rooms and walkways. Desperate, tortured, a fight breaks out that leaves Jan alone and wounded. A few days later, Jan and Matthieu meet again on the beach. Will they become friends again before they part? A journey of self-exploration, an odyssey of male adolescence, Prora is a thrilling, tender story about love and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actors Swen Gippa and Tom Gramenz are amazing, not only for being beatiful :-) , but also in the way they act while looking at each other in friendship or anger.&lt;/p&gt;

This 15 year-old blind teenager has to deal with the jealousy of his friend Giovana while figuring out the new feelings he's having towards his new friend, Gabriel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short and sweet, delicate and sensible, "Eu Não Quero Voltar Sozinho" ("I Don't Want to Go Back Alone") brings us the story of Leonardo (Guilherme Lobo), a blind teenager who develops a crush on Gabriel (Fabio Audi), a new boy in his school of whom he becomes friends, and Leonardo also deals with the jealousy of his long-time friend Giovanna (Tess Amorim) who is always taking him home, and now she's more on second plan after the appearance of Gabriel in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 17 minutes, the short explores two diversities that hardly ever are well presented in films (specially together) and hardly ever are not targeted or labeled by societies in general: people who are blind and people who has an affection/sexual interest on someone of the same sex. The use of both diversities is very relevant in a society that tends to ignore the difference or to deplore his similar human being just because of some variations. So, here's a movie that brings a better understanding on dealing with differences and why people must be tolerant to one another, to respect their individuality's. The film succeed it in this issue but not everyone got happy with this. Here's a sad story: this awarded short was selected by the government as part of a educational/cultural film program to be presented in schools, related on how sexual diversity must be respected and all, focused on students of the same age as the ones presented in the film. So far, so good, except that one state banned the film of their schools pressed by religious groups which only heard of the film. Very sad, since no one talked more about dealing with diversities in fair terms than the current government, and hearing that one state still wants to live like 50 years ago, without evolving in their laws, moral and all is such a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides this controversy, this is a must see film, well acted by the young cast and the few adults on scene. It has so many surprises to make your heart beat fast at all moments. One of the most beautiful short films I've seen.

&lt;p&gt;Two actors, a summer house in the countryside and fifteen days to shoot the film - that is all you need to create a masterpiece if you just have a good story at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icelandic "Rökkur" (or "Rift") is about two men that processes memories of an ended love relationship in a place where folklore says that memories are distorted and you can not trust your senses. This opens up a truly surprising story that made the audience at the Gothenburg Film Festival scream of fear in the packed theater.&lt;/p&gt;

A story of how hard it is to be sincere with each other, and a story of love of love that appears as soon as a wall between you and other person starts crumbling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of sincerity finds its clear reflection in the Russian title of the movie - Tonight I'll be myself. The title is nice, but it's better suited for some other movie, a movie with a clear idea of explicit decision. CJ, on the other hand, is a different person every night, with every client (today, for an instance, he is a guy from Utah). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ash, on the contrary, has to repeat, over and over again, that she is not a person she seems to be. This is why the heroes have to face sincerity, quite unplanned and unprompted. &lt;/p&gt;

Some internet troll created a short version of the movie. It features only the gay couple, and the result is "Love without limits".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is worth watching the short version, but if you wanna go deeper in the story, look for the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joao Cajuda and Joao Pedro Silva play the role of two young men who gets instantly attracted to each other. Initially, they try to hide it, but as the story develops, the get closer and closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you got in love with João Cajuda, know that he is one of the most famous Internet Celebrities from Portugal. He has a travel agency and has been all around the world recording his YouTube travel diaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme is not new and but it is something we need to debate. A couch involved in a forbidden relation with one of his minor students. The reveled truth, the decision, and the consequences.

A good, tasteful storyline sympathetically crafted for the screen by the director. Although it is in German, the English subtitles very quickly make you forget it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoyed the original music , with a subject such as a violin it would have been easy to use some populist pieces. Julian Lembke's score matched the mood of the film very well. Johannes Huth and Hannes Sell acted well and brought a natural and believable professionalism to their roles, this is so often missing in short films of this genre. Without the need for showing physical intercourse, Ilyushenko is restricted in his realisation of this encounter, yet manages in twelve minutes to give us what most directors can only hope to achieve in three times that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His story is both simple and engaging, moving and uplifting despite its lack of complication, showing us the transcendent power of music. A 'well-worth watching' short film, both engaging and uplifting which deserves to do well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Water | Vattnet</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/water-vattnet/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-22T16:06:52-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-22T16:06:52-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-22:/gay-short-movie/water-vattnet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;James leads a lonely life in a luxurious castle.

One day he finds himself interested in an injured, handsome Swedish soccer player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen minutes is not a great length of time to tell a whole story. So the director and writer, Marco van Bergen, simply takes a single issue, that of a great "what if", "if only I hadn't turned away", "if only I hadn't hesitated", and follows that idea from the position of a young Englishman staying in Sweden. While the film suffers from the same problems faced by many gay filmmakers of gay themes, namely that of low budgets restricting the scope of the work, the end result is aided by the fact that a 'localised emotion' (if the reader comprehends such a notion) need be dealt with only in a localised setting. (Note the emotional impact of Hitchcock's "Rear Window" or Natali's "Cube", neither of which goes beyond a very limited geography.) Vattnet (Water) will not make it as one of the great gay short film stories, but it is a pleasant observation of a moment that most of us in our earlier, and definitely 'clumsier' years will remember all too well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by a competent filming style and competent acting, and this cannot be a waste of a useful 14 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Starcrossed</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/starcrossed/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-22T16:01:31-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-22T16:01:31-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-22:/gay-short-movie/starcrossed/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starcrossed is a very sweet, sad, little movie about two brothers that are in love.

&lt;p&gt;Characters of diverse ages engage in new relationships or examine the ongoing ones they're involved in.

Both accomplished athletes, David finds himself embroiled in the typical feud between testosterone-fuelled sports atmospheres and friends of alternative lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short film plays gay conflict at a sometimes overly simple level, but the ambiguity introduced in regards to the status of the sexual identity of Niels, and his lack of importance to the critical narrative arc of David’s emotional growth is a welcome change from the norm. Although the film makers struggle with subtlety when portraying the elements of society that make life hard for LGBT individuals, they do well to preserve the innocence and integrity of its main characters, creating a heart-warming look at the strength and resilience of true friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those great British dramas set in a typically grim environment but shot with positivity throughout. Having grown up around the area in the film and being only a few years older than the featured boys, it was a joy to see life there depicted in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all previous comments about the actors and how true-to-life it feels. Although slightly exaggerated in places, this film is a great comment on London working class life as well as being focused around a gay-based storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to add that this film also comments on the complex class system in the UK which explains why Tony was dropped by Sandra. Many non-British viewers may not have picked up on this. Thoughout, Tony is shown as a middle class character who doesn't really fit into the working class environment. He uses different slang words to the others, has a 'posher' accent and has slightly different attitudes to all the other characters. He and Sandra come from different worlds. As Sandra says, she has been fighting all her life, whereas he has had evertyhing given to him on a plate. Ultimately, this relationship was never going to last. Life in London (and the UK) is still spilt into different social classes, although they do mix a little more than they used to. But you can often tell where someone is from by their accent and their choice of words. This was used to great affect in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

So often films such as this fall under the title 'Queer Cinema' and that is as unfair to the audience as it is to the writer and director of the film. This film is meant for the general public and should it receive higher profile in publicity, many longstanding prejudices would at least have the chance to be questioned by both gays and straights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurent (Cyrille Thouvenin) lives with his parents Jeanne (Danièle Denie) and Pierre (Idwig Stephane) behind the family Pharmacy. Laurent is secretly gay though he lives with his best girlfriend Carole (Caroline Veyt) who adores him and wholly accepts his sexuality and is content to serve as a 'front' for Laurent's closeted role with his parents. He is not doing well studying agriculture, primarily due to the fact the his close cousin Marc died recently and had been disowned by his aunt and uncle when he announced he was gay. Laurent can only see that he must keep his secret so that his parents (whom he loves deeply) will not be 'injured' by his admitting his sexuality. His marks in school are so poor that he is instructed to do an internship in field agriculture to raise his academic standing. His assigned tutor is Cédric (Stéphan Guérin-Tillié) who lives an openly gay life with his warmly understanding and loving mother Emma (Eva Darlan) in an idyllic garden setting that also serves as Cédric's agricultural research lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though instantly attracted to each other, Laurent maintains his closeted life until Cédric reveals his affection&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Fair Haven</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-movie/fair-haven/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-19T16:38:21-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-19T16:38:21-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-19:/gay-movie/fair-haven/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A young man returns to his family farm, after a long stay in ex-gay conversion therapy, and is torn between the expectations of his emotionally distant father, and the memories of a past, loving relationship he has tried to bury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair Haven provides a moving account of a father and son coming to terms with a family loss, and the struggle of trying to reconnect after this tragedy. It offers an honest and moving account of the son's readjustment to rural life after having spent time away, and the challenge of the father in rebuilding a close and loving relationship with his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the directing and writing of the film deserve specific praise. The audience is able to be taken along the emotional journey between father and son at a well thought out pace, with each chapter of their relationship unfolding without ever feeling rushed and portrayed by some strong performances from Michael Grant and Tom Wopat. The cinematography also deserves recognition, with the lush greenery of the Vermont farmland adding to the film's sense of 'real-life' authenticity. Fair Haven is a great example of all the best elements of indie film making,telling an important story of a topic that deserves more awareness and doing so with compassion without ever bordering into stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet cute little film. It's quick, well-done and the acting is good. The kiss is sweet and gentle and there's some casual male nudity (back view only) in a locker room scene.

&lt;p&gt;This short Australian film depicts with warmth and without pretension the awkwardness of two teenagers starting to recognise and explore their homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was refreshing to see two actors cast who were the right age for these roles and who showed no reluctance to share a kiss on screen. Many older actors/actresses of whatever sexuality could take a lesson from these two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final image of the film which relates to the title and storyline has a beauty and simplicity that surprises and lingers.&lt;/p&gt;

It was produced as part of the BBC Schools SCENE series, and intended for young adults. It confronted the Thatcherite government’s attempt to ban gay sex education in schools via the controversial (since repealed) section 28 legislation. Given this backdrop, the BBC opted not to show it during the day and it was screened at night, even though it was originally created for a school audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film centres on the life of Phil, a fun loving student in his final year at British secondary school. He is currently going steady with girlfriend Sharon, whose best friend Vera (an early role for Kathy Burke) just happens to have the hots for his best mate Matthew. However, Matthew is gay, and dropped out of school the previous year as a means of escaping the abuse of the classroom, only for the discovery of his collection of soft-core gay porn to cause him problems at home as well. Matthew is an ardent swimmer – an opportunity for the film to immediately use and confront an obvious stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil is torn between the realisation that whilst he loves Sharon, he equally has feelings for Matthew. He tries to have it both ways, introducing the one to the other – prompting Vera to describe him as a “little worm” when Sharon runs off in distress. Tired of the complications of life at home, Phil and Matthew decide to elope to the coastal resort of Seaford on the Sussex coast. Sharon follows him, determined to regain her “fella”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has two endings. In the original 1987 release, Phil returns to Matthew at the beach, and they run together into the ocean. The film was re-released in 1988 with an ending where Phil appears to leave with Sharon, but Matthew decides that life must go on and that he is his own person.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>After the Sky Turned Black</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-short-movie/after-the-sky-turned-black/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-16T16:26:37-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-16T16:26:37-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-16:/gay-short-movie/after-the-sky-turned-black/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A photojournalist, recently blinded in a terrorist attack overseas, picks up a young man from a bar and takes him home.

&lt;p&gt;“Rightfully delivered in an unhurried pace and well shot and scored throughout, this is a moving work on the risks that journalists of both text and photo mediums take, in documenting the brutal ravages of man’s inhumanity to mankind; a poignant narrative that will no doubt resonate with many. All of which makes for a short film that whilst gay to the core, speaks volumes on how being in the wrong place, at the wrong time, can forever change your life and that of those around you. And for a debut piece, that’s a telling message, indeed.” — Dave Hall, Gay Celluloid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the alarming increase in real-life tragedies involving high school bullying and suicide, Teens Like Phil tells the story of a gay teen, Phil, and his former friend, Adam, who brutally bullies him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film explores the complicated and painful circumstances surrounding this relationship in an effort to better understand the roots of the bullying epidemic. Phil’s story is ultimately a tale of survival and transcendence from this cycle of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

This is also a look at a gay teen’s blossoming sexuality as he falls in lust with his older neighbor and he becomes very excited when he spies Chad measuring himself in the bathroom.

Tim's aim: To understand Dave's motivations, to humiliate, degrade and kill him... But will he be able to go through with turning his dark fantasy into reality?  Together they relive their past and how they became the people they are. For six days, in a lonely motel room, a bitter and explicit private war rages between homosexuality and heterosexuality, between rejection and acceptance, reaching a climactic and unexpected conclusion.  Hot Legs is a controversial, psychological thriller that looks at the consequences of South Africa's previous, repressive, Calvinist, white, Apartheid school system on its students. By having the actor who portrays the bully completely nude from start to finish the scripts ability in a short time frame establishes the reversed vulnerability of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a film about taking responsibility for our actions and also about rejection..." says writer/director Luiz DeBarros.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some curiosity:
This short gay movie was recorded in South Africa, both actors were young art students. David acted in several other movies like District 9, but I couldn�t find anything else about Gerrie. Too bad, he�s cute, don�t you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
