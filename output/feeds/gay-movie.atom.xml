Some internet troll created a short version of the movie. It features only the gay couple, and the result is "Love without limits".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is worth watching the short version, but if you wanna go deeper in the story, look for the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joao Cajuda and Joao Pedro Silva play the role of two young men who gets instantly attracted to each other. Initially, they try to hide it, but as the story develops, the get closer and closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you got in love with João Cajuda, know that he is one of the most famous Internet Celebrities from Portugal. He has a travel agency and has been all around the world recording his YouTube travel diaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch an Interview (and also check some pics) here: &lt;a href="http://www.novagente.pt/joao-cajuda-entrevista-exclusiva-ator-e-um-dos-bloggers-mais-influentes-do-mundo"&gt;entrevista&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Barcelona - Summer Night</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-movie/barcelona-summer-night/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-22T12:03:48-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-22T12:03:48-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-22:/gay-movie/barcelona-summer-night/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed the crossing paths of the love stories in 'Love Actually', here's a refreshing alternative, this time set in a Barcelona awaiting the passage of a comet one summer night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters of diverse ages engage in new relationships or examine the ongoing ones they're involved in. Special attention is deserved by the gay couple formed by two young footballers of different projection and success, and the teen boy trying to get his dreamgirl, couched by his quirky step-sister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sequel set in winter is currently in the making, following the widespread acceptance of a film that deserves much praise for its modesty and sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This short movie was adapted from the original one. This is not the full lenght movie. The segment you are going to watch below refers to Marc &amp;amp; Jordi, the gay couple featured in the movie. Hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Beautiful thing</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-movie/beautiful-thing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-19T17:54:30-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-19T17:54:30-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-19:/gay-movie/beautiful-thing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Synopisis:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a suburb of London, young Jamie is escaping sport hours, to avoid being the victim of his comrades. Young Ste, his neighbor, is beaten by his father, and comes to sleep overnight. They discover new feelings, sleeping in the same bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those great British dramas set in a typically grim environment but shot with positivity throughout. Having grown up around the area in the film and being only a few years older than the featured boys, it was a joy to see life there depicted in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all previous comments about the actors and how true-to-life it feels. Although slightly exaggerated in places, this film is a great comment on London working class life as well as being focused around a gay-based storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to add that this film also comments on the complex class system in the UK which explains why Tony was dropped by Sandra. Many non-British viewers may not have picked up on this. Thoughout, Tony is shown as a middle class character who doesn't really fit into the working class environment. He uses different slang words to the others, has a 'posher' accent and has slightly different attitudes to all the other characters. He and Sandra come from different worlds. As Sandra says, she has been fighting all her life, whereas he has had evertyhing given to him on a plate. Ultimately, this relationship was never going to last. Life in London (and the UK) is still spilt into different social classes, although they do mix a little more than they used to. But you can often tell where someone is from by their accent and their choice of words. This was used to great affect in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a light-hearted look at life on a London council Estate with some great performances... one of my favourite films.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Just a question of love</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-movie/just-a-question-of-love/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-19T16:42:34-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-19T16:42:34-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-19:/gay-movie/just-a-question-of-love/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;'Juste une question d'amour' is a small film made for French TV that is one of the most sensitive, unbiased examinations of how the 'coming out' of gay men impacts not only the one who bravely steps forward but also his friends both male and female and his family.

So often films such as this fall under the title 'Queer Cinema' and that is as unfair to the audience as it is to the writer and director of the film. This film is meant for the general public and should it receive higher profile in publicity, many longstanding prejudices would at least have the chance to be questioned by both gays and straights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurent (Cyrille Thouvenin) lives with his parents Jeanne (Danièle Denie) and Pierre (Idwig Stephane) behind the family Pharmacy. Laurent is secretly gay though he lives with his best girlfriend Carole (Caroline Veyt) who adores him and wholly accepts his sexuality and is content to serve as a 'front' for Laurent's closeted role with his parents. He is not doing well studying agriculture, primarily due to the fact the his close cousin Marc died recently and had been disowned by his aunt and uncle when he announced he was gay. Laurent can only see that he must keep his secret so that his parents (whom he loves deeply) will not be 'injured' by his admitting his sexuality. His marks in school are so poor that he is instructed to do an internship in field agriculture to raise his academic standing. His assigned tutor is Cédric (Stéphan Guérin-Tillié) who lives an openly gay life with his warmly understanding and loving mother Emma (Eva Darlan) in an idyllic garden setting that also serves as Cédric's agricultural research lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though instantly attracted to each other, Laurent maintains his closeted life until Cédric reveals his affection&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Fair Haven</title><link href="https://www.thegaymoviecatalog.space/gay-movie/fair-haven/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-19T16:38:21-02:00</published><updated>2018-01-19T16:38:21-02:00</updated><author><name>Kael</name></author><id>tag:www.thegaymoviecatalog.space,2018-01-19:/gay-movie/fair-haven/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A young man returns to his family farm, after a long stay in ex-gay conversion therapy, and is torn between the expectations of his emotionally distant father, and the memories of a past, loving relationship he has tried to bury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair Haven provides a moving account of a father and son coming to terms with a family loss, and the struggle of trying to reconnect after this tragedy. It offers an honest and moving account of the son's readjustment to rural life after having spent time away, and the challenge of the father in rebuilding a close and loving relationship with his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the directing and writing of the film deserve specific praise. The audience is able to be taken along the emotional journey between father and son at a well thought out pace, with each chapter of their relationship unfolding without ever feeling rushed and portrayed by some strong performances from Michael Grant and Tom Wopat. The cinematography also deserves recognition, with the lush greenery of the Vermont farmland adding to the film's sense of 'real-life' authenticity. Fair Haven is a great example of all the best elements of indie film making,telling an important story of a topic that deserves more awareness and doing so with compassion without ever bordering into stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

It was produced as part of the BBC Schools SCENE series, and intended for young adults. It confronted the Thatcherite government’s attempt to ban gay sex education in schools via the controversial (since repealed) section 28 legislation. Given this backdrop, the BBC opted not to show it during the day and it was screened at night, even though it was originally created for a school audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film centres on the life of Phil, a fun loving student in his final year at British secondary school. He is currently going steady with girlfriend Sharon, whose best friend Vera (an early role for Kathy Burke) just happens to have the hots for his best mate Matthew. However, Matthew is gay, and dropped out of school the previous year as a means of escaping the abuse of the classroom, only for the discovery of his collection of soft-core gay porn to cause him problems at home as well. Matthew is an ardent swimmer – an opportunity for the film to immediately use and confront an obvious stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil is torn between the realisation that whilst he loves Sharon, he equally has feelings for Matthew. He tries to have it both ways, introducing the one to the other – prompting Vera to describe him as a “little worm” when Sharon runs off in distress. Tired of the complications of life at home, Phil and Matthew decide to elope to the coastal resort of Seaford on the Sussex coast. Sharon follows him, determined to regain her “fella”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has two endings. In the original 1987 release, Phil returns to Matthew at the beach, and they run together into the ocean. The film was re-released in 1988 with an ending where Phil appears to leave with Sharon, but Matthew decides that life must go on and that he is his own person.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
